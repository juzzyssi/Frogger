General documentation:
    (Further Documentation: Util > processing)

    The "interactives" package aims to deal with runtime reactive processes involved in the game's model such as those triggered between, say, the player &
    other "obstacles".

Interactive (iface):
    Interactives influence--in runtime--a wide range of either internal or external processes; the opposite is also true.

Toy:
    Toys are essentially dynamic & renderable instances of "Interactive".

SandBox:
    SandBox instances operate as holoistic runtime-interfaces dedicated to bridge either internal or external processes "provoked by" / involving toys.
