General documentation:
    Dynamic primitives provide the runtime vector-mutatiion logic required for concepts such as "motion".

Accelerator (iface):
    Accelerators provide runtime displacement vectors that opperate additively to Dynamic instances' displacement.

AcceleratorRegistery:
    Acc. registeries work as functional processors of a collection of "accelerators" that provide their runtime vector sum.

Dynamic:
    Dynamic instances provide simplified & automated vector processes that mutate in run time (accelerators); originally meant
    for screen displacement.
